/**
 * WhatsApp text markers, as a pure string operation.
 *
 * WhatsApp's styles are a client-side *text* convention: the gateway sends the
 * body verbatim and the recipient's phone parses `*bold*`, `_italic_`,
 * `~strike~` and ``` monospace ```. So nothing here talks to the server, and
 * nothing here models the text as HTML — there is exactly one representation,
 * the raw markup the operator can see in the textarea (PLAN.md §11.8).
 *
 * Everything the feature knows lives in `applyMark`, which is why it is a
 * standalone module: it is unit-testable without mounting the widget.
 *
 * The rules below are WhatsApp's, not a tidy string operation. Wrapping the
 * selection verbatim is the naive version and it is wrong wherever WhatsApp's
 * own parser disagrees — the toolbar must only ever emit sequences that render.
 */

 * The marks WhatsApp actually has. This is a whitelist, deliberately: Odoo's
 * own format group ships underline next to bold/italic, and WhatsApp has no
 * underline — offering it would let an author apply a style that silently
 * vanishes on the recipient's phone. Same for links: WhatsApp auto-links bare
 * URLs but has no anchor text.
 *
 * Monospace is the odd one out. It is block-ish rather than inline: it spans
 * newlines and suppresses the other styles inside it, so it neither snaps to
 * word boundaries nor splits per line, and the inline buttons disable while the
 * caret sits inside one.
