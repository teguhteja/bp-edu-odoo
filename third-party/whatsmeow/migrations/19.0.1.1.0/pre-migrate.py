"""Drop duplicate inbound messages so the new unique index can be created.

Until 19.0.1.1.0 the webhook deduped with a search-then-create, which cannot
hold against the gateway's concurrent retries, and WhatsApp itself delivers
some messages twice — the first copy empty, the second real. Both left two
rows sharing one wa_message_id, which the unique index would now refuse.

Keep the copy worth keeping: the real one over the empty stand-in, and the
later one when neither is a stand-in (that's the order they arrive in). The
stand-in's body is matched by text because these rows predate the
`is_placeholder` flag that replaces the guesswork going forward.
